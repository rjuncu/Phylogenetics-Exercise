# Phylogenetics-Exercise

This assignment was created for the Masters in Bioinformatics at KU Leuven. This paper is an evaluation of the evolution rate of Human Respiratory Coronavirus
OC43 reported by St-Jean et al. (2004). In that paper, sequences from a sample in 1967 and 2001
were shown to be unusually similar. Another paper by Vijgen et al. (2005) evaluated this claim,
showing the statistical improbability of such a low evolution rate. Statistical analysis of sequence
phylogeny is used in this paper to evaluate the hypothesis that the two samples had a substitution
rate much lower than those reported in other coronaviruses.
